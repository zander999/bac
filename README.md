# Minetest bac mod

This is my first public mod

## What it does

It adds 1 node, 4 tools and 1 bit of food. The one node is called a bac box it is a cube with the top off (the is middle holow).
The 4 tools are for minning 2 of them are also for other use. The minning tools are bac_pick, bac_pick_upgraded, bac_final and bac_laser.
The 2 other use tools are bac_final and bac_laser they act as a pickaxe, shovel, sword and a axe.
the 1 bit of food is a bac_edible you can eat it.
